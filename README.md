## Overview

This project is a 3 column component card. I use flexbox to make it as close as possible based on the image design.

### The challenge

I had to plan out how the layout was goin to be. How would I make the css codes something like reusable to put to other containers so that I don't have to repeat myself. This is quite challenging for me as noob.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

Before going to code, I plan how will I design the layout. I started with HTML first, what tags and elements should I need to include. CSS custom properties second. the div clasess and the media query I need to use based on the dev tools I looked. and do some small designs to make mine as close as possible to the project image.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I have to keep working on my CSS skills as I'm not confident with my current skill. Will build more small projects surrounding this. :)
